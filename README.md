# LeetCode_Daily_Problem_Solutions

This is a respository containing my Python3 solutions to [LeetCode's](https://www.leetcode.com) daily problems. 

I intend to revist each problem at least once to improve upon my intial solution, although I want at least a day to pass between writing my initial solution and attempting an improved solution. The notes column will call out either items I'd like to attend to on an attempt at an improved solution or else will contain snippets of things I learned or found useful in solving the problem more elegantly.

| Problem | Initial Solution | Improved Solution | Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|      https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/   |    [Initial Solution](https://github.com/lukemshannonhill/LeetCode_Daily_Problem_Solutions/blob/master/Easy/Length%20of%20Last%20Word.py)         | --- | To do: Construct a more elegant, one line solution exploiting existing string methods more fully |
