# LeetCode_Daily_Problem_Solutions

This is a respository containing my Python3 solutions to [LeetCode's](https://www.leetcode.com) daily problems. 

I intend to revist each problem at least once to improve upon my intial solution, although I want at least a day to pass between writing my initial solution and attempting an improved solution. The notes column will call out either items I'd like to attend to on an attempt at an improved solution or else will contain snippets of things I learned or found useful in solving the problem more elegantly.

| Problem | Initial Solution | Improved Solution | Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|      https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/   |    [Initial Solution](https://github.com/lukemshannonhill/LeetCode_Daily_Problem_Solutions/blob/master/Easy/Length%20of%20Last%20Word.py)         | --- | To do: Construct a more elegant, one line solution exploiting existing string methods more fully |
| https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/ | [Initial Solution](https://github.com/lukemshannonhill/LeetCode_Daily_Problem_Solutions/blob/master/Medium/Word%20%20Break.py) | --- | I'm certain the optimal solution uses tries. After reviewing tries I'll reattempt this problem. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie |
| https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/ | [Initial Solution](https://github.com/lukemshannonhill/LeetCode_Daily_Problem_Solutions/blob/master/Hard/Find%20Missing%20Positive.py) | --- | Although my initial solution is accepted by leetcode, I'm utilizing memory the optimal solution almost certainly wouldn't. Upon revisiting this problem, I'd like to ensure I utilize as little memory as possible (perhaps performing in place operations on the array?). |
| https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/october-leetcoding-challenge/559/week-1-october-1st-october-7th/3480/ | [Initial Solution](https://github.com/lukemshannonhill/LeetCode_Daily_Problem_Solutions/blob/master/Easy/Number%20of%20Recent%20Calls.py) | --- | The "to_remove" list is cumbersome and inelegant. I would like to use a queue when reattempting this problem. |https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/october-leetcoding-challenge/559/week-1-october-1st-october-7th/3480/https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/october-leetcoding-challenge/559/week-1-october-1st-october-7th/3480/
